## Image Size

For a website, image size should not exceed 1Mb. You can use any online software to compress your images.
For example on [img2go](https://www.img2go.com/compress-image) the option "Resize for Desktop" (just before "start" button) is giving good results.

## Content Search

To modify content you can search a post (**publication**, **member**, **news**, **...**) on the post list by keyword.

## Quick Edit

We suggest you to turn on **inline edit** on post list, it's usefull for quick edit (for example change image, add pdf or turn a member alumni).
