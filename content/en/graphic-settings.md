## Changing banner image for a section

Banners can be changing on Admnistrator Interface, for example Publications/Publications settings.

1. Remove the banner image you want to change.
2. Drag and drop the new image (and go directly to #6) or choose image on media library.
3. Choose the directory ("banner" seem to be the good one).
4. Choose new image.
5. Validate.
6. Update

<article-image src="publication-settings.png" alt="publications settings" 
size="100" :center="false">
</article-image>

Others banners can be changing in the same way, for example Jobs/Job settings, News/News seetings, etc...
